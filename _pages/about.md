I am a M.S. student in the [Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.unist.ac.kr/) at [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/), advised by [Prof. Hyemin Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/hyemin-ahn) at the [AI-HRI Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/ai-hri-lab). My research focuses on **Robotic Manipulation** and **World Models** for intelligent robot control.

Previously, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [Myongji University](https://www.mju.ac.kr/) in 2024, where I worked as an undergraduate intern at the Dynamic Robot Control Lab (DRCL) under the supervision of Prof. Dong-il Choi.
