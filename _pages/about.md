I am a M.S. student at [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/) [Graduate School of AI](https://ai.unist.ac.kr/), advised by [Hyemin Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/hyemin-ahn). I am interested in building **robotic foundation models**, with a focus on **world models** and **robotic manipulation**.

Previously, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [Myongji University](https://www.mju.ac.kr/) in 2024, where I worked at the Dynamic Robot Control Lab (DRCL) under [Dong-il Choi](https://www.mju.ac.kr/mjukr/253/subview.do?enc=Zm5jdDF8QEB8JTJGcHJvZiUyRm1qdWtyJTJGMTQ0JTJGNjA0NDIlMkZ2aWV3LmRvJTNG).
